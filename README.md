# SBBG_LFM
This code aims to visualize the historical LFM data collected by the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden.
Use the CSV data file, and the code should run and output graphs for two species: Chamise and Bigpod Ceanothus.

This code is updated at least annually, and Coast Live Oak LFM data will be added soon.
